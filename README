RSniffer
==================================================

RSniffer is a small tool, that allows to send pcap stream to remote host for futher analysis.
Main idea is to analyze traffic of the linux server using GUI Wireshark on desktop PC.
Optionally you can collect the traffic of several servers into dedicated trace server.

Usage scheme:
(Linux server) RSniffer ==[UDP TZSP/ERSPAN stream]==> (Linux/windows desktop) GUI Wireshark


How to run without ROOT privileges
==================================================
Normally rsniffer requires root privilleges to listen interfaces.
So, you can run it from root user or via sudo.

But there is an alternative solution - use setcap to grant rsniffer binary with required privileges.
Just run the following command:
[root@server ~]# setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' ./rsniffer


HELP
==================================================
rsniffer: capture packets via libpcap and transmit captured flow to external box using TZSP or ERSPAN protocol.

Usage: ./rsniffer [-h] [-l] [-E] [-s] [-i INTERFACE] [-p DEST_PORT] DEST_HOST FILTER_RULE
       ./rsniffer -l
	-v		Show version
	-l		List available INTERFACEs
	-h		Display this message
	-i		Capture interface (default: first interface)
	-p		Destination UDP port (default: 37008)
	-E		Use ERSPAN protocol (default: TZSP)
	-s		Silent: do not print counters during processing
	DEST_HOST	Send UDP flow to specified host
	FILTER_RULE	Filter rule for pcap library
